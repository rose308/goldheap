The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
@@Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all @9is@7 vanity.
What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?
@@@9One@7 generation passeth away, and @9another@7 generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.
The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.
The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.
@@All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea @9is@7 not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
@@All things @9are@7 full of labour; man cannot utter @9it@7: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
@@The thing that hath been, it @9is that@7 which shall be; and that which is done @9is@7 that which shall be done: and @9there is@7 no new @9thing@7 under the sun.
@@Is there @9any@7 thing whereof it may be said, See, this @9is@7 new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.
@@@9There is@7 no remembrance of former @9things@7; neither shall there be @9any@7 remembrance of @9things@7 that are to come with @9those@7 that shall come after.
@@@^I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
@@And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all @9things@7 that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.
@@I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all @9is@7 vanity and vexation of spirit.
@@@9That which is@7 crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
@@I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all @9they@7 that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.
@@For in much wisdom @9is@7 much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
@@I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also @9is@7 vanity.
@@I said of laughter, @9It is@7 mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?
@@I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what @9was@7 that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.
I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:
@@I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all @9kind of@7 fruits:
I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:
@@I got @9me@7 servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:
@@I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, @9as@7 musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.
@@Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all @9was@7 vanity and vexation of spirit, and @9there was@7 no profit under the sun.
@@@^And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what @9can@7 the man @9do@7 that cometh after the king? @9even@7 that which hath been already done.
Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
@@The wise man's eyes @9are@7 in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.
@@Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also @9is@7 vanity.
@@For @9there is@7 no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now @9is@7 in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise @9man@7? as the fool.
@@Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun @9is@7 grievous unto me: for all @9is@7 vanity and vexation of spirit.
@@@^Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
@@And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise @9man@7 or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This @9is@7 also vanity.
Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.
@@For there is a man whose labour @9is@7 in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it @9for@7 his portion. This also @9is@7 vanity and a great evil.
For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?
@@For all his days @9are@7 sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.
@@@^@9There is@7 nothing better for a man, @9than@7 that he should eat and drink, and @9that@7 he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it @9was@7 from the hand of God.
@@For who can eat, or who else can hasten @9hereunto@7, more than I?
@@For @9God@7 giveth to a man that @9is@7 good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to @9him that is@7 good before God. This also @9is@7 vanity and vexation of spirit.
@@To every @9thing there is@7 a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
@@A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up @9that which is@7 planted;
A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?
I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.
@@He hath made every @9thing@7 beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.
@@I know that @9there is@7 no good in them, but for @9a man@7 to rejoice, and to do good in his life.
@@And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it @9is@7 the gift of God.
@@I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth @9it@7, that @9men@7 should fear before him.
That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.
@@@^And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, @9that@7 wickedness @9was@7 there; and the place of righteousness, @9that@7 iniquity @9was@7 there.
@@I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for @9there is@7 a time there for every purpose and for every work.
I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
@@For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all @9is@7 vanity.
All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?
@@Wherefore I perceive that @9there is@7 nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that @9is@7 his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
@@So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of @9such as were@7 oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors @9there was@7 power; but they had no comforter.
Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.
@@Yea, better @9is he@7 than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
@@@^Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This @9is@7 also vanity and vexation of spirit.
The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
@@Better @9is@7 an handful @9with@7 quietness, than both the hands full @9with@7 travail and vexation of spirit.
Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.
@@There is one @9alone@7, and @9there is@7 not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet @9is there@7 no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither @9saith he@7, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This @9is@7 also vanity, yea, it @9is@7 a sore travail.
@@@^Two @9are@7 better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.
@@For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him @9that is@7 alone when he falleth; for @9he hath@7 not another to help him up.
@@Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm @9alone@7?
And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
@@@^Better @9is@7 a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.
@@For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also @9he that is@7 born in his kingdom becometh poor.
I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.
@@@9There is@7 no end of all the people, @9even@7 of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also @9is@7 vanity and vexation of spirit.
Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.
@@Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter @9any@7 thing before God: for God @9is@7 in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.
@@For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice @9is known@7 by multitude of words.
@@When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for @9he hath@7 no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.
@@Better @9is it@7 that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.
@@Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it @9was@7 an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?
@@For in the multitude of dreams and many words @9there are@7 also @9divers@7 vanities: but fear thou God.
@@@^If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for @9he that is@7 higher than the highest regardeth; and @9there be@7 higher than they.
@@@^Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king @9himself@7 is served by the field.
@@He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this @9is@7 also vanity.
@@When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good @9is there@7 to the owners thereof, saving the beholding @9of them@7 with their eyes?
@@The sleep of a labouring man @9is@7 sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
@@There is a sore evil @9which@7 I have seen under the sun, @9namely@7, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.
@@But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and @9there is@7 nothing in his hand.
As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.
@@And this also @9is@7 a sore evil, @9that@7 in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?
@@All his days also he eateth in darkness, and @9he hath@7 much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.
@@@^Behold @9that@7 which I have seen: @9it is@7 good and comely @9for one@7 to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it @9is@7 his portion.
@@Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this @9is@7 the gift of God.
@@For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth @9him@7 in the joy of his heart.
@@There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it @9is@7 common among men:
@@A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this @9is@7 vanity, and it @9is@7 an evil disease.
@@@^If a man beget an hundred @9children@7, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also @9that@7 he have no burial; I say, @9that@7 an untimely birth @9is@7 better than he.
For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.
@@Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known @9any thing@7: this hath more rest than the other.
@@@^Yea, though he live a thousand years twice @9told@7, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?
@@All the labour of man @9is@7 for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.
For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?
@@@^Better @9is@7 the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this @9is@7 also vanity and vexation of spirit.
@@That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it @9is@7 man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.
@@@^Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what @9is@7 man the better?
@@For who knoweth what @9is@7 good for man in @9this@7 life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?
@@A good name @9is@7 better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.
@@@^@9It is@7 better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that @9is@7 the end of all men; and the living will lay @9it@7 to his heart.
@@Sorrow @9is@7 better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.
@@The heart of the wise @9is@7 in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools @9is@7 in the house of mirth.
@@@9It is@7 better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.

In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.
@@All @9things@7 have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just @9man@7 that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked @9man@7 that prolongeth @9his life@7 in his wickedness.
Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?
Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?
@@@9It is@7 good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.
@@Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty @9men@7 which are in the city.

@@@^All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it @9was@7 far from me.
That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?

@@Where the word of a king @9is, there is@7 power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?
Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.
@@@^Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man @9is@7 great upon him.
For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?
@@@9There is@7 no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither @9hath he@7 power in the day of death: and @9there is@7 no discharge in @9that@7 war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.

@@And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this @9is@7 also vanity.
Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
@@@^Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his @9days@7 be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:

Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.
