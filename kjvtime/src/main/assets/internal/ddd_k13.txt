@@All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel @9were@7 of one heart to make David king.
And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.
@@Moreover they that were nigh them, @9even@7 unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, @9and@7 meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for @9there was@7 joy in Israel.
@@And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, @9and@7 with every leader.

And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.
And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim.
@@And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, @9that is@7, to Kirjath-jearim, which @9belonged@7 to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth @9between@7 the cherubims, whose name is called @9on it@7.

And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.
And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.
@@And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God @9home@7 to me?
@@So David brought not the ark @9home@7 to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.
Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.
And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.
@@@^And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.

@@@^And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard @9of it@7, and went out against them.
And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.
So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.
And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.
Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.
@@And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, @9that@7 then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.
David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.
And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.
@@And @9David@7 made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.

And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.
And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:
Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:
Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:

@@And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren @9to be@7 the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.

@@@^So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.

@@And David @9was@7 clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also @9had@7 upon him an ephod of linen.

@@@^And it came to pass, @9as@7 the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.
So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.
And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
@@And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon @9of wine@7.

Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.

Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.
Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.
Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.
@@Moreover @9there are@7 workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.
