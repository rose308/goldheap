Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,
@@Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, @9even@7 to the children of Israel.
Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.
From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.
@@There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, @9so@7 I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.
@@Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it @9to@7 the right hand or @9to@7 the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.
This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
@@Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God @9is@7 with thee whithersoever thou goest.
@@@^Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.
@@@^And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,
Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.
Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;
@@Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as @9he hath given@7 you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.
@@@^And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.
According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.
@@Whosoever @9he be@7 that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.
And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.
And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.
And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.
@@And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they @9were@7:
@@And it came to pass @9about the time@7 of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.
But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.
And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.
@@@^And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;
And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.
@@For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that @9were@7 on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
@@And as soon as we had heard @9these things@7, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he @9is@7 God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.
Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token:
@@And @9that@7 ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.
And the men answered her, Our life for your's, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.
@@Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house @9was@7 upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.
@@And the men said unto her, We @9will be@7 blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.
@@Behold, @9when@7 we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.

And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.
@@And she said, According unto your words, so @9be@7 it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
@@And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought @9them@7 throughout all the way, but found @9them@7 not.
@@So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all @9things@7 that befell them:
And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.
And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.
And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;
And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.
@@Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed @9this@7 way heretofore.
And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.
And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
@@@^And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, @9so@7 I will be with thee.
And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.
@@@^And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.
@@And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God @9is@7 among you, and @9that@7 he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.
Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.
Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.
@@And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, @9that@7 the waters of Jordan shall be cut off @9from@7 the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.
@@@^And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;
And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)
@@That the waters which came down from above stood @9and@7 rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that @9is@7 beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, @9even@7 the salt sea, failed, @9and@7 were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.
And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.
And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,
Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,
And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.
Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:
And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:
@@That this may be a sign among you, @9that@7 when your children ask @9their fathers@7 in time to come, saying, What @9mean@7 ye by these stones?
Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.
And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.
And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.
@@@^For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.
And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.
And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:
About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.
@@@^On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,
Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.
Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.
@@And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, @9and@7 the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as @9they did@7 before.
@@@^And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth @9day@7 of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.
And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.
@@And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What @9mean@7 these stones?
Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:
@@That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it @9is@7 mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.
@@And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which @9were@7 on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which @9were@7 by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.
@@@^At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.
And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
@@And this @9is@7 the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, @9that were@7 males, @9even@7 all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
@@Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people @9that were@7 born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, @9them@7 they had not circumcised.
@@For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people @9that were@7 men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
@@And their children, @9whom@7 he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.
And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.
@@@^And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.
@@And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched @9corn@7 in the selfsame day.
@@@^And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
@@@^And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, @9Art@7 thou for us, or for our adversaries?
@@And he said, Nay; but @9as@7 captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?
@@And the captain of the LORD'S host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest @9is@7 holy. And Joshua did so.
Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.
@@And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, @9and@7 the mighty men of valour.
@@And ye shall compass the city, all @9ye@7 men of war, @9and@7 go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.
And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.
@@And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long @9blast@7 with the ram's horn, @9and@7 when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.
@@@^And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.
And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.
@@@^And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.
@@@^And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, @9the priests@7 going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
@@And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall @9any@7 word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.
@@So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about @9it@7 once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.
@@@^And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.
@@And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, @9the priests@7 going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.
And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.
And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.
@@@^And the city shall be accursed, @9even@7 it, and all that @9are@7 therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that @9are@7 with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
@@And ye, in any wise keep @9yourselves@7 from the accursed thing, lest ye make @9yourselves@7 accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.
@@But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, @9are@7 consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.
@@So the people shouted when @9the priests@7 blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.
@@And they utterly destroyed all that @9was@7 in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.
But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.
And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.
@@And they burnt the city with fire, and all that @9was@7 therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.
@@And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel @9even@7 unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
@@@^And Joshua adjured @9them@7 at that time, saying, Cursed @9be@7 the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest @9son@7 shall he set up the gates of it.
@@So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was @9noised@7 throughout all the country.
But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.
@@And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which @9is@7 beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.
@@And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; @9and@7 make not all the people to labour thither; for they @9are but@7 few.

@@And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them @9from@7 before the gate @9even@7 unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.
@@@^And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.
And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!
O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!
@@For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear @9of it@7, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?
@@@^And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?
@@Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put @9it@7 even among their own stuff.
@@Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, @9but@7 turned @9their@7 backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.
@@Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, @9There is@7 an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.
@@In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, @9that@7 the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families @9thereof@7; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.
@@And it shall be, @9that@7 he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.

And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
@@And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide @9it@7 not from me.
And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
@@When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they @9are@7 hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
@@@^So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, @9it was@7 hid in his tent, and the silver under it.

And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.
And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.
And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.
And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:
And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.
@@@^So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.

@@@^Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.

@@And all the people, @9even the people@7 of war that @9were@7 with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now @9there was@7 a valley between them and Ai.

@@And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that @9is@7 in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that @9he had@7 in his hand toward the city.
And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.
And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.
And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.

And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.

@@The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if @9it be@7 in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)

@@And if we have not @9rather@7 done it for fear of @9this@7 thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?
For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.
Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:
@@But @9that@7 it @9may be@7 a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD.
@@Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should @9so@7 say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say @9again@7, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it @9is@7 a witness between us and you.
@@God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that @9is@7 before his tabernacle.
@@@^And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which @9were@7 with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.
@@And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD @9is@7 among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.
@@@^And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.
@@And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar @9Ed@7: for it @9shall be@7 a witness between us that the LORD @9is@7 God.
@@And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old @9and@7 stricken in age.
@@And Joshua called for all Israel, @9and@7 for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old @9and@7 stricken in age:
@@And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God @9is@7 he that hath fought for you.
Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.
And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.
@@Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom @9to@7 the right hand or @9to@7 the left;
@@That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear @9by them@7, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:
But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day.
@@For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but @9as for@7 you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day.
@@One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he @9it is@7 that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.
Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God.
@@Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, @9even@7 these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:
@@Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out @9any of@7 these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.
@@And, behold, this day I @9am@7 going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, @9and@7 not one thing hath failed thereof.
@@Therefore it shall come to pass, @9that@7 as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.

And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
@@And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, @9even@7 Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.
And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.
And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.
And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.
And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.
And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.
Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:
But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.
And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.
@@And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, @9even@7 the two kings of the Amorites; @9but@7 not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.
And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.
@@@^Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.
@@And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that @9were@7 on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.
And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;
@@For the LORD our God, he @9it is@7 that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:
@@And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: @9therefore@7 will we also serve the LORD; for he @9is@7 our God.
@@And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he @9is@7 an holy God; he @9is@7 a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.
If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.
And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.
@@And Joshua said unto the people, Ye @9are@7 witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, @9We are@7 witnesses.
@@Now therefore put away, @9said he@7, the strange gods which @9are@7 among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.
And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.
So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
@@@^And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that @9was@7 by the sanctuary of the LORD.
And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.
So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.
@@@^And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, @9being@7 an hundred and ten years old.
@@And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which @9is@7 in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.
And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.
@@@^And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
