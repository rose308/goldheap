@@Blessed @9be@7 God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;
Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.
@@And whether we be afflicted, @9it is@7 for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, @9it is@7 for your consolation and salvation.
@@And our hope of you @9is@7 stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so @9shall ye be@7 also of the consolation.
For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:
But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:
@@Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver @9us@7;
@@Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift @9bestowed@7 upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.
For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.
For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;
@@As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also @9are@7 our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.
And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;
And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.
When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?
@@But @9as@7 God @9is@7 true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.
@@For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, @9even@7 by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.
@@For all the promises of God in him @9are@7 yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.

Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.
Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.
But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.
For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?
@@And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is @9the joy@7 of you all.
For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.
But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.
@@Sufficient to such a man @9is@7 this punishment, which @9was inflicted@7 of many.

@@To whom ye forgive any thing, I @9forgive@7 also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave @9it@7, for your sakes @9forgave I it@7 in the person of Christ;

@@Furthermore, when I came to Troas to @9preach@7 Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,
I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.
@@Now thanks @9be@7 unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.
For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:
@@To the one @9we are@7 the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who @9is@7 sufficient for these things?
For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
@@Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some @9others@7, epistles of commendation to you, or @9letters@7 of commendation from you?

And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:
@@Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency @9is@7 of God;
Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
@@But if the ministration of death, written @9and@7 engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which @9glory@7 was to be done away:
How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
@@For if the ministration of condemnation @9be@7 glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.
@@For if that which is done away @9was@7 glorious, much more that which remaineth @9is@7 glorious.
Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:
@@And not as Moses, @9which@7 put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:
@@But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which @9vail@7 is done away in Christ.
But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.

@@Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord @9is@7, there @9is@7 liberty.
@@But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, @9even@7 as by the Spirit of the Lord.
Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;
But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.
@@For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to @9give@7 the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.
@@@9We are@7 troubled on every side, yet not distressed; @9we are@7 perplexed, but not in despair;
Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.
For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;
@@Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present @9us@7 with you.
@@For all things @9are@7 for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.

@@For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding @9and@7 eternal weight of glory;
@@While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen @9are@7 temporal; but the things which are not seen @9are@7 eternal.
@@For we know that if our earthly house of @9this@7 tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:

@@For we that are in @9this@7 tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.
@@Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing @9is@7 God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
@@Therefore @9we are@7 always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)
@@We are confident, @9I say@7, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.

Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.
@@For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to @9answer@7 them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.
@@For whether we be beside ourselves, @9it is@7 to God: or whether we be sober, @9it is@7 for your cause.

@@For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though @9it were@7 but for a season.
Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.
For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
@@For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, @9what@7 clearing of yourselves, yea, @9what@7 indignation, yea, @9what@7 fear, yea, @9what@7 vehement desire, yea, @9what@7 zeal, yea, @9what@7 revenge!

@@Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, @9I did it@7 not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.
Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.
@@For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which @9I made@7 before Titus, is found a truth.
And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.
@@I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all @9things@7.
Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;
How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
@@For to @9their@7 power, I bear record, yea, and beyond @9their@7 power @9they were@7 willing of themselves;
@@Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and @9take upon us@7 the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
@@And @9this they did@7, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.
Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.
@@Therefore, as ye abound in every @9thing, in@7 faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and @9in@7 all diligence, and @9in@7 your love to us, @9see@7 that ye abound in this grace also.
I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
@@And herein I give @9my@7 advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.
@@Now therefore perform the doing @9of it@7; that as @9there was@7 a readiness to will, so @9there may be@7 a performance also out of that which ye have.
@@For if there be first a willing mind, @9it is@7 accepted according to that a man hath, @9and@7 not according to that he hath not.
@@For @9I mean@7 not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:

@@As it is written, He that @9had gathered@7 much had nothing over; and he that @9had gathered@7 little had no lack.
@@But thanks @9be@7 to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.
For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.
@@And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise @9is@7 in the gospel throughout all the churches;
@@And not @9that@7 only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and @9declaration of@7 your ready mind:
Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:
Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.

@@Whether @9any do enquire@7 of Titus, @9he is@7 my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren @9be enquired of, they are@7 the messengers of the churches, @9and@7 the glory of Christ.
Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.
Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:
Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.
@@Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as @9a matter of@7 bounty, and not as @9of@7 covetousness.
@@But this @9I say@7, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
@@Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, @9so let him give@7; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.
@@And God @9is@7 able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all @9things@7, may abound to every good work:
(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.
@@Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for @9your@7 food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)
Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.
For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;
@@Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for @9your@7 liberal distribution unto them, and unto all @9men@7;

As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.

If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.
In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:
And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.
It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.
And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.

And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.
Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
@@For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except @9it be@7 that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.

@@Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but @9we do@7 all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.
@@For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and @9that@7 I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest @9there be@7 debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:
@@@9And@7 lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and @9that@7 I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.
@@This @9is@7 the third @9time@7 I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:
Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.
For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.
Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?
But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.
Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.
For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
@@For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, @9even@7 your perfection.
Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.
Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
Greet one another with an holy kiss.
All the saints salute you.
@@The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, @9be@7 with you all. Amen.
