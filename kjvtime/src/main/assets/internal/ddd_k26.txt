@@@^And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness @9was@7 about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.

@@And @9they had@7 the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.
@@Their wings @9were@7 joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.

@@Thus @9were@7 their faces: and their wings @9were@7 stretched upward; two @9wings@7 of every one @9were@7 joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
@@And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; @9and@7 they turned not when they went.

@@And under the firmament @9were@7 their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.

@@And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat @9it@7; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.

@@@^Behold, the Assyrian @9was@7 a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.
The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.
Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.
All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.
Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.
The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.
@@I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that @9were@7 in the garden of God, envied him.

And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.
Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:

Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
