<h1><a name="contact">WordSend Support and Contact Information</a></h1>
<p>WordSend is not officially supported by anyone, and it is not guaranteed 
either to work as advertised or to not do anything bad, but if you would like to 
try out the current software and provide feedback to
<a href="http://ebible.org/mpj/">the author</a> (Michael Paul Johnson) at your 
own risk, please do. You may contact me via
<a href="https://cryptography.org/cgi-bin/contact.cgi">my web contact form</a>, 
or use my sil.org address that 
includes my first, middle and last names, using the normal sil.org conventions 
or the address given on <a href="http://kahunapule.org/">our personal web site</a>. 
(Please pardon the puzzles, as I&#39;m trying to keep my spam flow under a thousand 
messages a day.) I do care what you think about this software, and how it can be 
made better.<br>
