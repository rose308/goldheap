TIPS
====

We cannot afford to offer free technical support. The font has, however, 
been through some testing on various platforms to be sure it works in most
situations. In particular, it has been tested and shown to work on Windows
2000 and Windows XP.

If you do find a problem, please do report it to <fonts AT sil DOT org>.
We can't guarantee any direct response, but will try to fix reported bugs in
future versions. Make sure you read through the 
Charis SIL FAQ (http://scripts.sil.org/DoulosSILfontFAQ).

Many problems can be solved, or at least explained, through an understanding
of the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:

Encoding: 
The fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so your application must support
Unicode text in order to access letters other than the standard alphabet.
Most Windows applications provide basic Unicode support. You will, however,
need some way of entering Unicode text into your document.

Keyboarding:
Charis SIL does not include any keyboarding helps or utilities. It uses the
built-in keyboards of the operating system. You will need to install the
appropriate keyboard and input method for the characters of the language you
wish to use. If you want to enter characters that are not supported by any
system keyboard, the Keyman program (www.tavultesoft.com) can be helpful.

Another method of entering some symbols is provided by a few applications
such as Adobe InDesign. They can display a glyph palette that shows all the
glyphs (symbols) in a font and allow you to enter them by clicking on the
glyph you want.

Rendering:
This font is designed to work with any of three advanced font technologies, 
Graphite, AAT or OpenType. To take advantage of the advanced typographic 
capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an
adequate level of support for Graphite, AAT or OpenType. See "Applications
that provide an adequate level of support for SIL Unicode Roman fonts" 
(http://scripts.sil.org/DoulosSIL_AdLvSup).


INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
==============================

In Windows XP, open the Fonts control panel (Start, Control Panel,
Appearance and Themes, then look in the upper left). Then drag the font
files (CharisSILR.ttf, CharisSILB.ttf, CharisSILI.ttf, CharisSILBI.ttf) into
the window - or choose File, Install New Font..., and navigate to the files.
