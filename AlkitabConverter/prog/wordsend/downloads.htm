<p>You must install the .NET runtime prior to installing WordSend.</p>
<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>
<p>Before installing WordSend on Microsoft Windows XP, you must
install the Dot NET runtime (see the downloads above) if you haven't
done so, already. To install WordSend on Windows XP, just run the
self-installing executable file you downloaded. If you already have a <b>newer</b>
version of WordSend installed and are going back to an older version
(not usually a good idea), or if you have any version of Onyx
installed, you should <b>uninstall it before installing a
different version</b>. Other than that, installing over the top
of an older version should not cause any problems.</p>
<p>If you wish to try the command line tools on another platform
(Mac OS X or Linux), first install <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">Mono</a>,
then unzip <a href="wordsend-console-2010-12-11.zip">wordsend-console-2010-12-11.zip</a>
to a suitable directory and include that directory in your executable
file search path. The cross-platform abilities of this distribution are
not fully tested, and not necessarily useful until some of
the bugs in
<a href="http://openoffice.org">OOo</a> that
prevent proper rendition of very complex WordML have been exterminated
or until I implement the direct conversion to Open Document Text (ODT),
whichever comes first.</p>
<h2><a name="history">History</a></h2>
<p>If you want to download an older version of WordSend for some
reason, please click on the release date of that version. Not all older
versions are available. If you find a problem with an older version,
please see if it is still a problem with the current version before
<a href="http://cryptography.org/cgi-bin/contact.cgi">reporting
it to the author</a>. The tested version may not actually be any
more stable than the current version, but it has been tested more. The
current version will have the latest feature additions.</p>

<td style="vertical-align: top;">11 October 2006</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Corrected a bug
where non-standard markers could cause generation of improper WordML
that Microsoft Word couldn't read.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">10 October 2006</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Corrected a
problem where a newer font could be overwritten by an older font on
installation. Replaced "Onyx" with "WordSend" in the source code,
changing the name of the default log file, the main name space (for
programs that use BibleFileLib.dll), etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">4 October 2006</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Added Python
script plug-in to launch WordSend usfm2word.exe from the Paratext 6
checking menu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">26 September 2006</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Updated
documentation and renamed the project, web site, and mailing list to
WordSend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">19 April 2006</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Converted source
project to Microsoft Visual C# 2005 Express Edition, and thus to
requiring Dot NET runtime version 2.0 instead of 1.1.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">28 March 2006</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Corrected critical
failure in extract-usfx.exe that caused this program to die before
doing any useful work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">20 March 2006</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Corrected link
error in documentation. The new distribution format is a single .exe
file, not a .zip file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">17 March 2006</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Changed default
handling of qStart and qEnd markers in usfx2usfm.exe to better reflect
USFX best practice.<br>
Changed the installation program to use the freeware <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page">NullSoft
Install System</a> instead of the expensive Microsoft Setup while
correcting some compatibility issues. This also makes for an
easier-to-use single self-installing compressed executable. It also has
more efficient compression and lower overhead to do essentially the
same job (but a little better), so the downloads are quicker.<br>
Because of the change of install/uninstall systems, you should
uninstall any previous version before installing this version.<br>
Starting with this version, the install system adds a registry entry
under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SIL\WordSend\Install_Dir containing
the directory that WordSend was installed to. (This is to make it
easier for other programs to find the executable files associated with
this project.)<br>
Made font installation and desktop icon installation optional in the
installer program.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">7 March 2006</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Added command line
switch to permit specification of the log file name to use. Corrected a
problem with cross reference footnotes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">6 March 2006</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Added font
installation to Windows installer for a better first-time-run
experience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">10 November 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Enhanced the setup
program to add the program installation directory to the system search
path for ease of use of the command line utilities in this project.<br>
Added usfx2usfm.exe command line utility to convert from USFX to USFM.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">25 October 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Reversed attempt
at Mono-friendly function to determine executable file path, as it
didn’t actually work.<br>
Corrected bug in SFMInfo.xml affecting footnote markers inadvertently
introduced with the last version.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">22 October 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Separated out
Mono-friendly portion of this project and made a separate distribution
for command line tools.<br>
Enhanced support for front and back matter.<br>
Corrected a problem with \w ... \w*.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">9
September 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Added support for
front and back matter.<br>
Corrected a problem with the "All files" filter not working when
selecting USFM input files.<br>
Corrected some more problems with USFX interleaving with WordML.<br>
Updated the USFX Schema to be more tolerant of marker order variations.<br>
Added a command line tool (extract-usfx.exe) to extract USFX data from
a WordML document with embedded USFX.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">30
August 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Added crop marks
insertion option on "Extras" tab.<br>
Added support for styles new with USFM 2.03.<br>
Corrected one problem with USFX insertion.<br>
Added support for \cl. The chapter label in \cl overrides the setting
for chapter or psalm label prefix in the options dialog, if present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">24
April 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Added
documentation on picture placement. Changed automatic computation of
drop cap spacing from text to be slightly narrower to avoid problem
with interference with column separator line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">21
April 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<p dir="ltr">Corrected a problem where an extra
blank line could sometimes appear just before a new paragraph that is
also the start of a verse, when the last line of the preceding verse
was full. (The “blank” line had a cvmarker style
chapter number in it for the running headers.) Added character style
mapping for \w ...\w* to go to “Word listed” style.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">13
April 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Corrected a
problem with the footnote character style sometimes being applied after
a footnote has ended. Added a new footnote character style
“Quoted from text” for \fq, reassigning \fqa to
“Alternate reading.” (The \fqa character style
marker is in the USFM 2.0 spec, but it wasn’t in the
sfminfo.xml file before this version.) Toggled the default for marking
verse 1 and chapter 1 to “true.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">9
April 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Yet another bug
fix quick release— this time improving the error handling if
you have an non-supported USFM backslash code in the input and
correcting the default unit processing for the last two of the manual
drop cap parameters to really be half-points instead of twips, as
documented. Changed USFX embedding to be enabled by default.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">8 April 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Corrected problem
with USFX embedding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">7 April 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Enhanced automatic
drop cap dimension computations to also read and take into account
space before in the Normal-ch style and adjusted the scaling factors
for better results over a wider range of point values. For best
results, use "exact" spacing instead of "single" spacing on the Normal
font. Corrected several problems with the way USFX was integrated into
WordML. Thanks go to Randy H. and Tim G. for valuable feedback
contributing to this version.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">6 April 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<p dir="ltr">Added “Help” button
and revised the documentation. Added feature to automatically calculate
drop cap dimensions based on the Normal paragraph font size in the seed
file. This makes it more likely that drop caps will look good with
various seed files without you having to mess with the manual
parameters. The manual parameters are still there, if you need them.
They have been changed in the way they now store both a number and a
unit of measure. In testing, I found some bugs in the USFX embedding
that are still there from last release, but I'll get at least these
edits posted before tackling those.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">1 April 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Corrected a bug in
the setup file generation system that caused the last few updates to
actually be older versions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">21 March 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Debugged &amp;
enabled the <a href="http://eBible.org/usfx/">USFX</a>
(custom XML) embedding in WordML files. Embedding USFX in WordML files
is a prerequisite to converting USFX+WordML back to USFM, but the
converter to do so is still to be written. As a consequence of adding
this feature, two more styles are implemented: "Invisible" (character
style) and "Invisible Paragraph" (paragraph style). These are used to
preserve things like the free-form text portion of the \id tag, which
has no place in the visible portion of the typeset WordML document.<br>
Added a direct USFM to USFX converter to the usfm2word.exe "extras"
page. (This function will probably be moved elsewhere, later, but will
remain available.)<br>
Added \hr to sfminfo.xml and the Horizontal Rule style to the sample
seed files. You can safely ignore this change if you don’t
use \hr, which is not in USFM, but was in the old PNGSFM. It was easier
for me to support than to tell the translator he couldn't use it.
&lt;grin&gt;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">3 March 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Moved merge
crossreference footnote marker insertion point so that Microsoft Word
wouldn’t break a line just after a verse marker. Changed
character style name generated by \it ...\it* to Italics and added that
style to the sample seed files. (This marker is depreciated, and it is
recommended that you use something else instead, but it is still in the
USFM standard for now.) Tweaked the display of the default seed file
created with a new .xini file to reflect the location of the default
seed file (Scripture.xml in the directory where the program was
installed). Changed the substitution list so that it can accept a
character in the form of its Unicode hexadecimal code point, U+xxxx,
like U+8239 for a narrow non-breaking space, so that the resulting
substitutions are more readable. This also makes it easier to find an
editor and keyboard to make some substitutions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">18 February 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Added character
and paragraph styles for tags that are new with USFM 2.0 that
weren’t in USFM 1.53. These include \em...\em*, \sr, \pm,
\pmo, \pmr, \qm#, \pro...\pro, and \wj...\wj*. Added new character
styles that are only applied to the first normal poetry or prose
paragraph of a chapter when drop cap chapters are selected: Normal-ch
and Poetry Line 1-ch. The purpose of this differentiation is to allow
you to specify additional space above or alter the indent settings on
those paragraphs adjacent to the chapter number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">2 February 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Added Gotchas,
Known Issues, and Tips section to this document. Removed some
development logging code that was causing conflicts on startup of
multiple copies of usfm2word.exe. Corrected a problem with chapter
labels (not drop caps) when \c is not immediately followed by a tag
that causes a new paragraph to start.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">31 January 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<p dir="ltr">Added additional cvmarker fields to
substantially increase the probability that a partial last verse of a
chapter at the beginning of a page will cause that earlier chapter to
be noted in the running headers. Removed the macros from the sample
seed files, since they aren’t needed any more. Added a new
character style to the seed file called "Hidden" which is cvmarker +
font hidden. If your seed file doesn't have this style, you will get
some extra spaces in the output at the end of every text run that
begins with a verse marker. This style is used to separate the cvmarker
invisible text at the beginning of a verse from that at the end. You
can copy this style from one of the distribution seed files, or just
create it to upgrade an existing seed file.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">25 January 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Corrected an error
in sfminfo.xml affecting only the sls (secondary language source)
style. Changed the headers in Scripture.xml to just have the book and
chapter number or range of chapter numbers on the outside rather than
book and first chapter on the left and book and last chapter on the
right. After this version, I plan to separate the releases into latest
and latest stable versions. The tweaks to this version were intended to
stabilize this one before I tackle finishing the USFX embedding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">21 January 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> Oops! I didn't
quite get the setup settings right to include the fixquotes.xml file
and its schema, changelist.xsd in the setup list with the 19 January
release. A minimalist release process makes it easy to goof-- but also
easy to release a fix. Here is that fix. Sorry for any inconvenience...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">19 January 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<p dir="ltr">Added a feature that allows certain
global search &amp; replace operations (consistent changes) to be
done on the text (not tags) of the Scriptures for the purpose of
normalizing quotation mark spacing, replacing character sets with
ligatures, etc. (I use it to change &lt;&lt; to “,
&gt;&gt; to ”, and -- to —, and to put
non-breaking narrow spaces between consecutive quotation marks.)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">6 January 2005</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Squashed a bug that
could cause footnotes and crossreferences to be improperly rendered by
Microsoft Word. Enhanced verse bridge rendering to change normal dashes
to non-breaking hyphens to prevent line breaks in the middle of a verse
marker. Note that the font used must support this character, U+2011 or
Alt-8209.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">8 December 2004</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Changed the name of
the “template” file to “seed”
file to avoid confusion with Microsoft Word template files. Updated web
page to include a link to dotnetfx.exe for better CD-ROM distribution.
Squashed some bugs, including one that may have prevented automatic
opening of Microsoft Word upon completion of the conversion process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">16 November 2004</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Added a macro to
Scripture.xml to normalize consecutive typographic quotation marks to
have a narrow no-break space between them.<br>
Made some cosmetic changes to the program.<br>
USFX insertion into the WordML is still not ready for prime time, so I
still recommend leaving this feature disabled (the default).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">7 November 2004</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Added a feature to
merge crossreference notes from an external file, translating the book
name or abbreviation on the fly. The \x tag in the main USFM source is
also supported, but this method can save time if you don’t
need caller symbols on your crossreference footnotes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">4 November 2004</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Added a single
command line parameter to the Windows GUI version of the program: the
name of the project parameter file to use. For example:<br>
usfm2word c:\path\to\mylanguage.xini<br>
This feature is intended to be used with batch files or calls from
other programs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">3 November 2004</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Corrected problems
in SFM parsing that caused problems with how spaces around footnotes
and verse markers appeared in some cases.<br>
Added “advanced” adjustments for drop cap
parameters.<br>
Corrected prototype Scripture “template” so that
drop caps work in the Psalms. (I still think drop caps work better
everywhere but the Psalms, and chapter headings are better there, but
at least you now have a reasonable choice.)<br>
Corrected some footnote behavior.<br>
Created some additional prototype Scripture templates.<br>
Added some code to embed USFX tags in the WordML. You can optionally
activate this code, but the tag embedding is not yet correct and
complete as of this version, so I recommend leaving that option off,
for now.<br>
Defined <a href="http://eBible.org/usfx/">USFX</a>,
at least for a starting point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">5 October 2004</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Beta test version:
minimal documentation included above. Several open issues still exist,
but many bugs fixed. This version is being posted just prior to
implementing some changes to support reversibility of the
transformation (i. e. embedding of USFX in the WordML).</td>

Corrected a problem with two instances interfering with each other.<br>
Known issues:<br>
Still not reversible (i. e. you can’t go back from WordML to
USFM, yet).<br>
No support for tables.<br>
Drop caps in Psalms are not as bad, but there are still some issues
with how Word displays some of them.<br>
Drop cap formatting is not as configurable as I would like.<br>
Automatic open of Microsoft Word on converted file may not always work.
